          <h2><span class="text-primary">The preparation</span> of pulihora</h2>
          <p>
            The pulihora is prepared with kokum, tamarind, lemon or green mango as main souring ingrident, along with blend of spices, lentils, peanuts and jaggery cooked in oil and mixed with cooked rice along with fried curry leaves. It remains fresh till two days. So, many South Indian travelers carry the prepared tamarind rice at the time of long journeys.
                
            Pulihora gojju (paste) or Pulihora podi (powder) is often pre-made at homes in southern India and stored for months. It is mixed with cooked rice in a pan to make pulihora instantly.
            
            Pulihora is usually cooked on special occasions and festive days. It is presented to God as part of prayers known as prasadam in most of the South Indian temples as well as South Indian homes.
